# Inside Cross Val

### Insights into how the error varies with change in K while performing k-fold Cross Validation

#### Plotting change in Error Mean and Variance with change in `K`

1. For values of `k` which divide `N`, the number of samples
2. For all values of `k`

##### In Case 1

- Error Mean does not change with K
- Error Variance decreases with increase in K

##### In Case 2

- Similar Overall Trend as Case 1
- The plots are much more sensitive and fluctuating
